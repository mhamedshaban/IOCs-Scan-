🧩 IOC Automation Tool — Local Installation Guide (Windows)

Prepared by: Mohammed Shaaban
Purpose: Enable each team member to install and run the IOC Automation Tool on their own machine.

⚙️ Step 1 – Download Project Files

Ask each team member to download or copy the following files from the shared folder:

ioc_app.py
requirements.txt
sample_ioc.xlsx   (optional test file)


Place them in a folder such as:

C:\IOC_Tool

🐍 Step 2 – Install Python

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
.

Download Python 3.10 or newer.

During installation, check the box ✅ “Add Python to PATH”.

Click Install Now and wait for setup to finish.

Confirm it’s installed correctly by opening Command Prompt and typing:

python --version

📦 Step 3 – Open Command Prompt in the Folder

Press Shift + Right-click inside C:\IOC_Tool.

Choose “Open PowerShell window here” or “Open in Terminal”.

You’ll now be inside the correct directory.

🧱 Step 4 – Create a Virtual Environment

This keeps dependencies clean and separate for each user.

python -m venv .venv


Then activate it:

.\.venv\Scripts\activate


(You should see something like (venv) appear at the start of your command line.)

📚 Step 5 – Install Required Libraries

Install everything listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt


If you face issues, install manually:

pip install streamlit pandas openpyxl


(Skip google-generativeai if you’re not using Gemini API.)

🚀 Step 6 – Run the Tool

While still in the same terminal and virtual environment, run:

streamlit run ioc_app.py


Then open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:8501


✅ You should now see the IOC Automation Tool interface.

📂 Step 7 – Use the Tool

Click Browse files and select your IOC Excel file.

The app will automatically:

Extract all IOCs.

Classify them into IP, Domain, and Hash.

Remove duplicates.

You can download clean .txt files for each category.

🧩 Step 8 – Troubleshooting
Issue	Cause	Fix
Streamlit not found	Not installed	pip install streamlit
“openpyxl not found”	Missing Excel library	pip install openpyxl
App doesn’t open	Port issue	Try: streamlit run ioc_app.py --server.port 8502
Command not recognized	Python not added to PATH	Reinstall Python with “Add to PATH” checked
